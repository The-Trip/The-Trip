# The-Trip

## What is it?

TheTrip.io is a platform to help you plan a successful and enjoyable holiday. There are 3 main areas it helps you plan are :

1. Flights - currently a flight search engine using the kiwi.com API
2. Hotels - hotel search using Google Places API
3. Places - a wider search using Google Places API

Another key feature of The Trip is suggestions from friends. By sharing an invite URL with your friends you can ask for their ideas about where to go in a destination. These suggestions are more valuable than lists found on sites such as Tripadvisor as they are from your friends. People who know you are more likely to know the kinds of places you would like to visit.
